# crexcel

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Monpt7/crexcel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Monpt7/crexcel)

crexcel is a crystal library to generate XLSX files almost like this [python module](https://github.com/jmcnamara/XlsxWriter)

**Important note :** this library only works with the master branch of Crystal for the moment. 0.24.2 version doesn't work but I hope 0.24.3 will!

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  crexcel:
    github: Monpt7/crexcel
```

```

A very tiny doc is available here : https://monpt7.github.io/crexcel/
